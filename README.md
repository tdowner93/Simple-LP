# Model Description
A golf course offers tee times throughout the week and seeks to maximize its revenue. Weekday tee times are priced lower due to lower demand, while weekend tee times are priced higher. The course operates under constraints including limited daylight hours, staffing availability, and necessary maintenance periods. The goal is to determine the optimal number of weekday and weekend tee times to schedule to maximize revenue.
